Click the install link above to install this userscript. Please make sure to check out the compatibility section to see if your userscript engine is compatible.

# Description

Adds a button to Twitch that allows you to "click-to-insert" an emote. Emotes are always up-to-date using Twitch's API and will only show the emotes that you can actually use.

# Categories

Emotes are categorized in two groups to make it easier for you to use them and to use them quickly.

## Popular Emotes

Emotes that you use frequently. The more you use an emote, the more likely it is that it will appear here. You can reset at any time and the popular will default to a few that I've noticed are popular within the community.

## All Emotes

All emotes that you can possibly use, including subscription sets and Turbo sets. They are sorted in this order (top-to-bottom):

- Basic Emotes ( ![:)](http://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/jtv_user_pictures/chansub-global-emoticon-ebf60cd72f7aa600-24x18.png ":)") and the Turbo set alternatives)
- Non-basic Emotes (everything that isn't a basic emote and not a subscription set)
- Subscription Emotes (sorted by the subscription ID) (Note: each group of emotes are colored based on that subscription ID)

# FAQ

#### Q: Why aren't my Turbo / Subscription emotes showing up?
A: Twitch's API sometimes does not load all of your emotes. Refresh until they come back--this is not something I can fix at the moment.

# Compatibility

Although the script may work on other platforms, they have not been fully tested and there may be bugs. Unless listed otherwise, compatibility tests are done using the latest stable release of the various browsers/userscript engines and older versions may not be supported at all. It is *highly recommended* that you always use the latest version of each platform. If you find a problem with the script, or want compatibility with a certain userscript engine, please post an issue and I will see what I can do.
